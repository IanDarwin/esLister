= esLister

Take pictures of things and catalog them.
Allows multiple pix per item, a brief description,
and an estimated valuation.

Useful for estate sales, yard sales/downsizing, etc.
Hence the name: esLister can stand for:

* Estate Sale Lister
* Extra Stuff Lister
* ex's stuff Lister

There will hopefully be plugins to allow uploading the
lists to various auction sites.

== N.B. Re Checkout

The program name is "esLister", but Flutter requires
a lower-case directory name.
Github doesn't care, so please, when cloning this repo,
clone it as "eslister" not as "esLister".

== Logo

The tawdry logo is from a sketch I did for an earlier
(and now dead) program called jrLister,
which was a desktop app with similar scope.
If you don't like the logo, make me a better one :-)
