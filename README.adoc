= esLister

Take pictures of things and catalog them.
Allows multiple pix per item, a brief description,
and an estimated valuation.

Useful for estate sales, downsizing, etc.
Hence the name: esLister can mean:

* Estate Sale Lister
* Extra Stuff Lister
* ex's stuff Lister

== N.B.

The program name is "esLister", but Flutter requires a lower-case directory name.
Github doesn't care, so please, when cloning this repo, call it "eslister" not "esLister".

== Status

Just a sketch/WIP for now.
