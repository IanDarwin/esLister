= esLister: Design Notes

An app to allow you to catalog a bunch of "extra stuff" or prepare for an "estate sale".
Intended to be useful both for professional appraisers and for individuals wishing to catalog 
a bunch of "stuff" for sale - antique furniture, paintings, jewelry, for a
well-to-do person's estate, or those extra ugly chairs that you keep in the
garage.

= Data

Should allow entry of the data items:

. Item name
. Location
. Notes
. Take pictures (typically 2-3 but no hard limit!)
. Initial assessment value

What should be mandatory? I suppose just the first two items.

Initial setup to include a "One Sale or Multiple" choice; "Multiple"
will give a chooser for different estate sales you are working on,
or different partners' stuff that's being sold, etc.
"One" will remove thd dropdown.
If you change your mind from one to many, all the current items
appear in the new "First" catalog, which you can rename.

== Upload

There shall be an open-ended list of uploaders, e.g., 
eBay, Kijiji, proprietary estate companies, etc.
Initially only one need be provided, probably eBay.
